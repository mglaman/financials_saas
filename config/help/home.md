"Who Needs a Budget?" is a financial planning tool. That makes the name kind of ironic, doesn't it? Everyone wants to manage their finances, but some don't want to become an account or sit and learn epic techniques. Think of this as the happy blend between crazy spreadsheets and tools like [YNAB](http://www.youneedabudget.com/).


###Features

This app is focused around a few things
* Everyone has debts or assets (accounts.)
* Assets and debts fluctuate in their value (transactions/transfers.)
* We've all got expenses that happen each month (budgeted items.)

#### Accounts

Accounts are anything which hold monetary value and contribute to your net worth. You bank accounts, student loans, property, even vehicles. The point of adding accounts it to keep track of where your value is. This also allows you to eyeball your total net worth.

Accounts have the following attributes

* **Account Name** Straight forward and simple, how are you going to recognize this account?
* **Initial account balance** This should be the exact monetary balance the account has when added. It'll be used to historical data. *This field can be edited after saving, however the ruins its purpose (unless starting over.)*
* **Current account balance** This is the account's balance in real time. your net worth is based off of this value.
* **Account type** Straight forward as well. Assets add to your net worth (savings, property) and debts (loans, lines of credit) deduct from your net worth.

The current account balance field exists for one major reason: No one wants to sit and log every transaction. Here's an example: My student loans are spread across 5 individual accounts by a single provider. I'm not going to log the interest charges as transactions across all of them. Payment transactions will be logged against my savings account, but I will manually manage the student loan balances.


#### Transactions & Transfers

Transactions are applied to accounts and affect the *current account balance.* Transactions belong to an account and either increase or decrease it's value.

Example: Credit card account (debt)
* **Adding an expenditure** Your credit card account would be marked as a *debt*. Let's say you bought lunch and it cost $12. You'd add a transaction for **12**.
* **Adding a balance payment** You've paid your bill! You've decreased the balance. Let's say you paid $100 on your balance. You'd add a transaction for **-100**

Transfers are transactions, but save you a step. Borrowing from the credit card example, it'll allow you to specify **100** was transferred from Savings to Credit Card. This will update both account balances.

#### Budget Items

Everyone has recurring monthly expenses - mortgage or rent, phone, insurance, bill payments. The Budget page allows you to catalog all of these monthly expenses as budget items. This view allows you to track income and expenses. You'll end up with a list of known expenses and income, along with a net total that you'll typically have left over.

Example: Me! This is why I created this.
* I know I have *x* paychecks a month.
* I know I will have to pay my mortgage, ISP, mobile, insurance, and lines of credit.
* I know there's a set expenditure on cat and dog food.
* Food. Family of 3 has a pretty set food cost.

Once these budget items are in, I can see how much expected money I'll have at the end of the month. Based on this amount, I can choose to add a new budget item called "savings" to put away, or choose to focus a new budgeted amount towards student loans.

It's pretty much the same as what most budgeting tools provide, but less granular. And that's what I need/want.
